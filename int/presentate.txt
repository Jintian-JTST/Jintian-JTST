What is integration?For a student who is at normal educational level, I think it is not very difficult to answer. Even though, I choose to produce such a huge vedio to show you how to understand it in phyiscs perpective. To realise this, I found a problem for you. We consider this situation: There is a long stick nearby a massive point, which the point is on the perpendicular bisector of the stick, or the same straight line where the stick is at.How much is the gravitational force acting on the massive point, according to the long stick?The animation below illustrates those two situations.PLease pause this video and try to think it individually at first.

Now let's look at the basic theory: gravitational theory.This is about two massive dots, which one is red and the other is green.The distance between them is r, and the mass are m one and m two respectively. It is known to all that the gravitational force between them is gravitational constant times m one and m two, divided by r squared.This force of attraction will get changed, if the distance changes, while keeping their mass constant.But now lets think further: what if the massive point no longer be a point?I mean, for example, be a block or sth.Yeah, you could surely say it doesn't matter, thus we only need to calculate its mass centre.But what if the block becomes bigger? bigger? and even more bigger?In this way, the force are not balance on each point on the object, and this is the situation we are facing. Now I will introduce a special method to make sure thateverything is going on the right track. That is called, integration, which is calculate the sum of the each value of a specific function.
For here, we mainly use it to calculate each attractive force of point on the stick, then sum up to get the accurate value of the gravitational attraction act on the point.
We cut the stick into small parts. those small parts are so tiny that we can even consider each of them as a piece of paper, which is in 2-dimension and only have tiny thickness. We just need to calculate each in gravitational formula. Assume that the mass of the massive point is m, while the mass of the whole stick is capital M. Let the length of each piece of the stick is dx, which x here stands for the length of the stick, and d here stands for a small amount of change in distance.

Now we can start. Consider the second situation, as it seems to be easier. make those two things arrange in the same straight line, which the point is on the left hand side of the stick. Firstly, create a single dimension coordinate system, which let the point be the orgine and only have x-axis. To make things clear,I drag the axis down a little bit so that it is more easy for you to understand. Then let the distance between left end of the stick and the point be a, and length of stick be l, which means position of the right end is a plus l. Secondly, calculate a single piece of stick. We assume that length of each piece is dx, so the whole stick is divided into l over dx pieces. Due to the total mass is capital M, mass of each piece is... It is  M times dx divided by l. Then we move on to the formula, by simple calculation, and substitute what we have already known into the equation, we can find out that this piece has the force of the product of gravitational constant, Capital M, dx, and small m, divided by l, and x squared. Remember, this is only one piece. We need to add all of them together, which is so called integration. It seems hard, but really simple, which from basic words, is write an integration sign, and starting point at the bottom, that is the distance from the left, a, and ending point at the top, that is the distance from the right, a plus l. Then by calculators or maybe you brain, use the knowledge you have learnt, intergrate the equation and we get the final answer.

Then comes the first situation, which is the point is on the perpendicular bisector. Create a coordinate system, which is two-dimensional, with the orgine at the mid-point of the rod, marked as letter O. Again, let the distance between massive point and orgine be a. Assume that, for each piece, their left hand edge has the position of (x,0), which the distance to the orgine is x.  Same as the second one we have already discussed, for each piece of the stick we have the force of the product of gravitational constant, Capital M, dx, and small m, divided by l, and y squared, that y here is the distance between the piece and the massive point. Notice the Pythagoras Theorem, that the sum of the squares on the legs of a right triangle is equal to the square on the hypotenuse, we can express the distance y in terms of x and a, that y equals to the square root of a squared add x squared. substitute into the formula, that is the force of simple piece act on the point. But things becomes a little bit different here, that force is a vector, it has direction, that two opposite forces may sometimes cancel each other, for instance, the case below here.() Review that piece of rod, factorise the force into vertical and horizontal directions, mark as Fx and Fy. To tell you the truth, we don't have to calculate Fx, since two same pieces which both of them enjoy the same distance to the orgine can cancel each others' horizontal force.() Now, we should move on to Fy. From Pythagoras Theorem we know the ratio of a and c is a over the square root of a squared and b squared, that a and b are two legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse. See the situation here, that ratio is a over the square root of a squared and x squared. So Fy is the product of gravitational constant, Capital M, small m, and dx, divided by l, and a squared add x squared, times a over the square root of a squared and x squared. Now the following words are repeated: Remember, this is only one piece. We need to add all of them together, which is so called integration. It seems hard, but really simple, which from basic words, is write an integration sign, and starting point at the bottom, that is the distance from the left, minus l over 2, and ending point at the top, that is the distance from the right, positive l over 2. Then by calculators or maybe you brain, use the knowledge you have learnt, integrate the equation and we get the final answer.

The whole question ended here, all the deducement are written here.But to tell you the truth, if you are a high school student, and prepare to study physics in the near future, I have no doubt that you can work out this problem easily, which all the animations I've done are useless. However, this is not the real purpose I make this video, but to invite a heat discuss of, what is the use of integration, I mean, in pyhsics area? Or even further, for all mathematical method?====

We know that since ancient times, equations are founded in order to sovle unknown values, especially when calculating the behavior of materials and forces, it's common for a scientist to use algebra to solve for values of variables given other constants and variable values. Also, geometry. Phase space, a strong and energetic method of analysing fields, from gravitation to electric, from magnetic to nuclear. What's more, linear algebra. Mainly used in quantum physics, to Matrix Force Method by Bohr's model of hydrogen and Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In addition, typology. Gauss' law and Ampère's law in electrodynamics are both topological in nature: they involve line or surface integrals that remain invariant under continuous deformations of the underlying curve or surface. Last but not least, integration, the main topic today.From my perpective, the use of integration, is just to sum up everything that human cannot exactly and directly calculate. Cut everything into small pieces, so that the mistakes can even not be able to consider. Then sum up, sum up! There's nothing interesting and fresh. Maths is used for physics. Maths is the tool of physics.  
Since Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica was first published on 5 July 1687, a great revolution in physics had spread the light of mathematics on a science which up to then had remained in the darkness of conjectures and hypotheses. Since then, more and more fields are occupied by physics, especially after the 20th century, when Heisenberg's work on the spectrum of hydrogen atoms in quantum mechanics broke the gap between chemistry and physics. It can be said that physics, as the principle of everything, is the study of everything in the universe, from the sea of stars and planets, to the strange and charm quarks, all of them can be covered by this precise and uncertain world. And that's why I wanna to devote myself on phyiscs.自从《自然数学的哲学原理》于1687年7月5日首次出版以来，物理学的一场伟大革命将数学之光传播给了当时仍处于猜测和假设黑暗中的科学。从那以后，越来越多的领域被物理霸占，尤其是自20世纪以来，海森堡在量子力学方面对氢原子光谱的研究，更是打开了化学与物理之间的隔阂。可以说，物理作为万物之理，是研究宇宙中一切的物质的学科，大到星辰大海，小到奇粲夸克，都是这个精确而又不确定的世界所能包罗的。而这，才是物理令我着迷所在。
Here's the Reference List：大家好。我是金田。这是我第一次做这样的视频，似乎比较硬核。我只是一个普通高中生，对微积分的理解并不一定全面，但是我仍然希望将我的想法传播出来，让大家能够指出我的问题。全程使用英文也是为了锻炼一下口语和写作能力。我的读音也不标准，更谈不上地道。因此不要有人来在争论我的个人能力，绝对比不上b站人均清华的水平。这期视频花了整整一个暑假，原计划在8月中旬做完。但是我不指望能有很高的播放量。我在做一件比较新颖的事情，这个视频是由Manim完成的，是一个基于python和anaconda的库，由来自Stanford University的Grant Sanderson创立。希望这个视频多少对你有帮助，也能对我有帮助。感谢观看。
